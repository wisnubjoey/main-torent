## Why
- Marketing needs a dedicated landing page to showcase vehicle rental inventory and trust signals.
- Current application lacks a consumer-facing entry point for discovery and booking.

## What Changes
- Add a landing page route and Inertia view presenting hero, trust badges, teaser catalog, feature highlights, premium/sport car sections, and contact details with map.
- Provide responsive layout (desktop grid, tablet, mobile) with Tailwind classes and carousel interactions.

## Impact
- Introduces new marketing page alongside existing dashboard flows.
- No backend data writes; depends on static configuration and mocked data for initial launch.
